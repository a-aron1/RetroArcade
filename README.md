## Wordle!
Brought to you by RetroArcade -- we deliver you the best in in-console entertainment from yester-year!

### Rules

Your challenge is to guess a five-letter word in six attempts. 

After each guess you make, you're told which of your chosen letters are in the target word (if so, marked yellow), and whether they are in the right place (if so, marked green). 

### Other Useful Tips
- You can only play once per day.
- The new Wordle word comes out at midnight NYC, USA time.
- At the end of your daily game, you'll get a handy little count-down timer until the start of the next game!

Want to track your stats?  We took care of that for you.  They appear in a handy little summary for you at the end of each game.

### Can't wait till midnight to play again...?
- We understand!
- You can relaunch the app to get a new Wordle word puzzle
- Of course, you'll do it after the game finishes...
- Don't worry, we won't tell anyone -- it'll stay our little secret, shhhh ;)

And of course, if you are a true Wordle aficianado, you can find the live game [here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), but it's a once-a-day thing, so we are kinda partial to our own

And that's it.  Enjoy!
